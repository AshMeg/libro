      				<h2 class="mb-4">A letter to a friend</h2>
      				<p><br>Let us get started with the end, and maybe then the beginning will finally make sense. A message was received outlining - as one would expect the doctor would tell you when the dreaded big C finally made its way through your body - of pending nuptials. Clinically hardly gives the word justice, but English - as it often does - falls short of conveying the lack of empathy hidden between those black letters and white spaces. The message stated that my mother had given her diary acceptance through Facebook, commiting herself to cross-world travel mission to see someone throw too much money at a photoshoot so everyone else can smile and pretend they are still friends.
              </br><br>
                But we get ahead of ourselves. This message came from someone that had been known for the good part of 25 years. Someone who had received friendship in abundance, while giving little of herself up in return. A clinical message of such bleached emotion stating towards the fact that she had now gotten 153 likes on Facebook for a top pinterest inspired ring on her left hand, as red blotched eyes, with a full face of makeup and hair windswept from the water that graces the back porch of the house, was captured in a moment from someone who conveniently was there at the time.
              </br>
              <br>
              Bitter, I hear you say? No, friends, there are no sour lemons here. Merely someone overly fascinated with true colours - something that Pocahontas can attest to, as they travel on the polluted wind and leave a foul smell behind them. This is more of an experiment looking into the psychology behind how someone can not understand what an absolute asshole they have been, and missed a prime opportunity to build any bridges - whether of the swing variety or that of the Golden instead - based on one momentous occasion. Instead there was a surgical precision to the very bold ‘Fuck you’ that was squashed in every space between the full stops and and lack of emojis.
            </br> <br>
            The tale truly begins with a harrowing encounter endured by yours truly which was met with the same biblical understanding from the newly owner of a diamond ring that many religions give when accepting any new or different thinking into their flock; pitchforks and hand sized nails included. That linked with the fact that even though her phone is most definitely superglued to her small hands, she is incapable of actually replying to messages to the friend who sends letters, flowers, gifts, support, love and travels countless times to see her, because updating her Facebook feed with a Kim Kardashian type pose is more important. She is, as every meme, status and tagged photo says ‘rolling in winter rolls’, with a serious need to ‘diet and get back in shape’ as she wears an XS and most likely has the same amount of fat on her as the lopsided apple sitting on my desk. From there it was a rather quick descent into the trash can; the tattered edges of a shallow friendship left to float amongst the scraps on the street.
          </br> <br>
            Weeks, months, hours that can never be reclaimed, and tears that would only help to aid the rising sea levels were left with a battered fake eyelash and a contour that left overly puckered lips with a rather nasty look to them. And then we are here. With the message. That came through in the dark hours of a Tuesday morning. And no amount of cigarette smoke could take the horrid taste out of my mouth as i screenshotted the crime scene and tried to dissect the emotions to the listening ears. The jury sat patiently, as the CSI team explained how they swept the area - Facebook the main scene of the crime, with the message coming in hours later spoke to the motive. The MO of the now ex-friend seemed to be of inflecting the most pain. The preverbal ‘Fuck you’ firmly outlined in Exhibit A, if it pleases the court. And it did: guilty was the verdict, screamed to an empty room.
          </br><br>
          And the sentence I hear myself ask? There are two options, as the state sees it: rehabilitation, or total annihilation. The first requires the victim to plead their apologies, smile as if gracing the red carpet with her best foot forward and declare her thorough involvement in the upcoming festival or the ‘you know we love each other because we have put ourselves in massives amounts of debt to show you’. Or, the second, takes inspiration from every petty moment of life mixed together in a melting pot of anger and hurled, rather forcabley, and the life of the want-to-be reality star, and spit at the memory of it all; swooshing cape and black heels included.
        </br><br>
          Let the petty reign, I say. Size 6 shoes, XL cape will do. Can I have a shot of vodi with that too? Great, I accept.
        </br><br>
          The messaging app was finally closed, the screenshots deleted because the need to hurl my phone across the room would mean I would have to choose between buying a new one, or eating - and we all know which one would be chosen. And this, dear reader, is where I leave you. The matter resolved in the eyes of Justice - a rather large fellow that moves too slowly to actually entice any change - and his cruel mistress Fate, a small looking lady, with a flower print dress, tight curls and a look of constant disapproval behind a passive aggressive smile nod in agreement that this should be left till the least expected moment, where I assure you, I will not be ready.
